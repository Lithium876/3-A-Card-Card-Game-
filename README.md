### About Game
The game begins after all the players receive three cards and a random card is selected from the deck. You then have to check your hand if any of your cards match with the random card selected from deck. 
If none of the cards in your hand matches the random card from the deck or played by someone else then you would have to pluck/draw a card from the deck which will end your turn; however if you or other players have a card that matches the random card selected from the deck or played by someone else then the matching card can be played with any extra card.
